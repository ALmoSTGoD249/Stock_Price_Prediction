# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

This project demonstrates how to predict stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with Python. The model is trained on historical stock data to predict future closing prices.

## Features
- Fetches historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.
- Normalizes the data using Min-Max Scaling.
- Builds and trains an LSTM model to predict future stock prices.
- Plots the actual vs. predicted stock prices.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following libraries installed:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`
- `tensorflow`
- `yfinance`

You can install them using:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow yfinance
